## DESCRIPTION
This application makes it easy to manage a store product database. It allows products to be put in categories and tagged for easy search and sorting. It makes use of a detailed MySQL database and I had to learn to connect multiple tables to make it work. 

## INSTALLATION
This program will need to be linked to a frontend to work properly. Please contact a web developer.
